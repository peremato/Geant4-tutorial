# An set of tutorials for Geant4.jl

This is a collection of Jupyter notebooks quickly covering various aspects of the Julia bindings for Geant4. It is assumed some familiarity of Geant4 itself.

The set of notebooks can also be processed by [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) into a set of web pages.

- The `environment.yaml` file can be used by conda/mamba to setup the appropriate set of Python packages to do this.
