    "# Introduction to Geant4.jl\n",
    "\n",
    "Geant4.jl provides the Julia bindings for the [Geant4](https://geant4.web.cern.ch) particle transportation toolkit. It is using [CxxWrap.jl](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/CxxWrap.jl) package to wrap C++ types and functions to Julia. Since the Geant4 toolkit is rather large and complex, writing the wrapper code by hand is not really an option. For this we use the package [WrapIt](https://github.com/grasph/wrapit) that automates the generation of the wrapper code making use of the clang library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation of the concepts and how to write applications with the Geant4 toolkit can be found with the [Application Developer Guide](https://geant4-userdoc.web.cern.ch/UsersGuides/ForApplicationDeveloper/html/index.html) or the [Classes and Members reference guide](https://geant4.kek.jp/Reference/11.2.0/index.html) for a detailed description of each C++ class. In this tutorial we will only highlight the differences between the Julia and the C++ API. We will document the additional types that have been added on top of the C++ classes to make the user interface more Julia friendly. To distinguish these new types from the types coming directly from C++ via the CxxWrap wrappers, these types are prefixed with `G4JL`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "The Geant4.jl package does no require any special installation. Stable releases are registered to the Julia general registry, and therefore, it can be deployed with the standard `Pkg` Julia package manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please note that the first time the `Geant4` package is added it may take some time since it downloads all the binary libraries and data files of Geant4** "
